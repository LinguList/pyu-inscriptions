Inscriptions in the Pyu language (ca. 4th-8th centuries CE in Myanmar)

This repository exists to support collaborative work on the small corpus of inscriptions in "Pyu", a probably extinct language that belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family, was written in a system of writing closely related to the system used in CampƒÅ, and constitutes the oldest (and least understood) corpus of inscriptions from Myanmar. No hard dates, but presumably between 4th and 8th centuries CE, with a small episode of further epigraphic production in the 12th c., when Pyu may have ceased to exist as a spoken language. The corpus is small, less than 50 entries in the inventory so far, and many of them coin legends or other small stuff.
